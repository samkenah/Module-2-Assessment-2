                 <P>Mr Price Group Limited is a publicly traded retail company based in South Africa. Founded in 1985, Mr Price opened in 1987 after the owners bought a controlling interest in John Orrs Holdings, whose trading divisions at the time were The Hub and Miladys.

It targets a wide range of customers and is well known for its fashion-value offering. The groupâ€™s trading divisions have evolved over time which has expanded its offering to apparel, cosmetics, homeware and sportswear merchandise through five trading divisions, namely: Mr Price, Miladys, Mr Price Sport, Mr Price Home and Sheet Street. It services its customers through its extensive store network as well as through its online platforms. It also has an established financial services division, Mr Price Money, which focuses on offering credit and insurance products, as well as a fast growing cellular offering.</P>
