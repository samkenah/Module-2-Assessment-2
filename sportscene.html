In March 2020, Foschini Group announced that, during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the company would cease to pay rents for its retail locations during the resultant lockdowns in South Africa.[3][8]

During the course of 2020, Foschini Group acquired the chain of Jet stores from an ailing Edcon, further expanding their footprint as a retail conglomerate.</P>
