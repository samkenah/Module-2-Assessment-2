                 <P>The Shoprite Group of companies was established in 1979. In 1990 Shoprite opened in Namibia. In 1991, it acquired the national Checkers chain. In 1995 the first store in Lusaka, Zambia, was opened. That same year they acquired a centralised distribution company Sentra, which had been acting as a central buyer for 550 owner-managed supermarkets, thereby allowing Shoprite to expand into franchising.[7]

In 1997 struggling "OK Bazaars" was acquired by the company from South African Breweries for one rand,[8] adding 139 OK Bazaars stores and 18 Hyperamas to the company.[9] In 2000 the group opened its first supermarkets in Zimbabwe and Uganda.[10][11] Two years later the company acquired the Madagascar stores of French chain Champion. The same year the company bought three Tanzanian supermarkets from Score Supermarket and opened it first Hypermarket outside of South Africa in Mauritius. In 2005 the Group acquired Foodworld as well as South African ticket seller Computicket, and opened the first Shoprite LiquorShop. The company also opened its first Nigerian store in the Victoria Island area of Lagos in December 2005.[12][13]</P>
