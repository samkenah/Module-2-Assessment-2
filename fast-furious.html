                 <h3>FAST-FURIOUS</h3>
          
               <P>Furious 7 (titled onscreen as Fast & Furious 7) is a 2015 American action-thriller film, directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the sequel to Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and the seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. In the film, Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes, until Deckard Shaw, a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again. The film also marks the final film appearance of Paul Walker, who died in 2013, and the film is dedicated to him.[5]

Plans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of Fast & Furious 6. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film. Casting began showing the returns of Diesel and Walker that same month. Principal photography began in September in Atlanta, and ended in July 2014 after resuming in April to allow Paul's brothers Caleb and Cody as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes for the film, which was delayed to its current release date; with other filming locations including Los Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo.

Furious 7 premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3. Upon release, the film became a critical and financial success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. It grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which was the second highest of all-time. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the fourth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of release. The sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released in April 2017.</P>
